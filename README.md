Point2CAD Reconstruction Algorithm and Visualization

This GitHub repository hosts an application built with Gradio for visualizing and reconstructing CAD models using point clouds using Point2CAD. 

The Point2CAD algorithm is taken from https://www.obukhov.ai/point2cad BY by Yujia Liu, Anton Obukhov, Jan Dirk Wegner, and Konrad Schindler. 

The implementation of the algorithm is from https://github.com/YujiaLiu76/point2cad .
